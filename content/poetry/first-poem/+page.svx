# Digital Autumn

Leaves of logic fall through silicon trees,
each bit a season passing, memory released.
The kernel hums its eternal song,
while processes dance, then move along.

In registers cold, warmth still resides—
the human touch that code still hides.
We build in winter, plant in spring,
and in the autumn, watch data sing.
